CLARITY: 

Title&Caption

I assume the couple of lines on top of the plot is your caption. So what is the defination of WIFI hotspot? I guess you are talking about new york city public wifi access points - LINKNYC program?  Or is it some commercial/residential hotspots? We will need more guidance on what we are looking at. 
Also by 'each transperated red dot is WIFI location and darker means more than one WIFI spot is located on the map', you mean transparent or lighter red colored? And it confuses me about 'draker', some locations looks like there is a cluster of dots, but the color difference is not much. I suggest you use more clear color and bigger aphla value.






is the plot easy to read? is it clear or confusing, are the quantities being visualized ambiguous? 

ESTHETIC: 



beautiful is a subjective judgment: you should not judge the plot on the basis of whether you think it is "beautiful", but you should judge whether its esthetic is functional to what it is meant to communicate. Are the colors chosen appropriately? Are the graphical elements used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized? Are the graphical choices allowing you to focus on the right elements or are they distracting you?

HONESTY: 


is the plot honestly reproducing the data or is it deforming it, perhaps to emphasize a point?
