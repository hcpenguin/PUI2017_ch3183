Review:


CLARITY: 

The plot is clear, readers wouldn't go wrong about what the author intends to convey is the subway locations information in new york city. The location dots have been plotted on an outline map of all 5 boroughs of New York City, and x and y axises give clear indications of latitude and longitude. The total quantity of all stations doesn't match the '473' in caption though. I assume it is because some subway lines share the same platform or have platforms in multiple ground levels even though at same location.You might want to make a note about this in caption.

ESTHETIC:  

It is very nice that the background is very clear and in 'cool' color so won't distract reader to view the location dots. And all colors are approperiate,people with all 3 main types of color blinds won't have hardtime to read it.


We are missing a legend here since you have dots in different colors. What is the color code here? It doesn't seems to be coded as the line routes. Can this caused by multiple lines share the same location?

# FBB good point

From the plot we know Staten Island doesn't have subway, you can point it out in your caption as a find so it makes more sense to include this borough on map. Include it or not really depends on what you want to show, big picture of where the stations are or stations coordinates.
The plot and caption probably can be better arranged, so the plot can be in the middle and caption can be line wrapped to match the width of picture. What do you think? Or is this just because of the cropping from screenshot? 
Another small thing is 'New York City' might be better than 'NYC' in the title, I might be too picky on this one, but if a reader just look at the plot, they might not clear about what 'NYC' stands for.

HONESTY: 

Other than the dots overlayed each other and causes color differences as be stated in first paragraph, the plot honestly reproduces the data and give very clear information of subway stations geo information on map. If you want to show all locations with unique coordinates, this is correct; if you want to show all stations with all lines, you will need to add station quantity information for each unique spot.

# FBB feedback on review

The grid is very distractive, it is hard to use it to identify the lat-long of a station because it does not extend into the surface of NYC, so it is only useful near the water boarders.
The clarity is compromised by the black on black display which makes NYC hard to spot altogether in the plot and the empty water space jump to the eye, partly because of the grid: white on black is what the eye is drawn to, much more than pink or blue, and it is quite hard to focus on NYC. In addition the thickness of the borroughs boundaries is thinner than the grid. adding to confusion missing units on the axis (degree)

Honesty: the caption stations are plotted over a map of the 5 borroughs, but the boundaries of the borroughs are either not plotted or not visible

esthetics: the overwhelming darkness of the plot is tricky: in print it would likely not render well. it is harder to see details than in the reverse color (white on black) - the background should be given less relevance than the foreground

# FBB ok though
10/10
