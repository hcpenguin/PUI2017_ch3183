Review:


CLARITY: 
The plot is clear, readers wouldn't go wrong about what the author intends to convey is the subway locations information in new york city. The locations dots have been plotted on an outline map of all 5 boroughs of New York City, and x and y axises give clear indications of latitude and longitude. The total quantity of all stations doesn't match the '473' in caption though. I assume it is because some subway lines share same platform or have platforms in multi-level, so they are in same location.You might want to make a note about this in caption.

is the plot easy to read? is it clear or confusing, are the quantities being visualized ambiguous? 

ESTHETIC: beautiful is a subjective judgment: you should not judge the plot on the basis of whether you think it is "beautiful", but you should judge whether its esthetic is functional to what it is meant to communicate. Are the colors chosen appropriately? Are the graphical elements used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized? Are the graphical choices allowing you to focus on the right elements or are they distracting you?

HONESTY: is the plot honestly reproducing the data or is it deforming it, perhaps to emphasize a point?
