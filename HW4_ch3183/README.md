**Assignment 1:

Review classmate's Citibike project proposal
Comment on the yt1369's notebook and give suggestions about the test.




**Assignment 2:

This assignment was done by team and each one did one choice of tests

't-Test' ChunChieh Tsai.           NetID:cct367

'Path Analysis'.  Ci He            NetID: ch3183

'Logistic Regression'.  Yuwei Lin  NetID:yl5240

# FBB good, interesting papers 

**Assignment 3:

Reproduce the analysis of the Hard to Employ program in NY
Finished reproducing the notebook cell2 and cell10.
Stated the results of the tests in term the rejection of the Null (for both tests and both for the original "Ever employed in a CEO transitional job" data and the "Convicted of a felony after 3 years data").



**Assignment 4:

Use the following are 3 tests to assess correlation between 2 samples of citibike data:
Pearson’s test
Spearman’s test
K-S test(also use this reducted datasets on this test, 200 times smaller)

Many thanks to Zhiao Zhou(zz1749) who helped me on the last test exercise to load right location filter stations.(riders from manhattan and brooklyn)
